# bikesharing

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to visualize data from the CitiBike bike sharing program in New York City. In this analysis we will take the data for the month of August 2019. We will explore The customer base, peak hours of use, the duration of the trips taken and the most popular locations.

We will use ou5r analysis to decide weither to recomend trying to launch a similar service in De Moine, Iowa.

The visualizations have been published on Tableau Public and can be accessed [HERE](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/justin.smith2295/viz/CitiBikeVisualizations_16559565991170/CitiBikeAugust2019?publish=yes)


## Visulaizations

![hourly breakdown](/images/hourly_breakdown.png)
This plot shows the over peak usage of the service. The darker the shade of blue the more bikes checked out in that hour. 

We can see from this the peak times on weekdays are from 7 to 9 am annd 5 to 7 pm. This is likely because many customers are commuting to work.

On weekend there is not as defined of a peak. Bikes are utilized from 10 am to 6 pm at a pretty consistant rate

![gender breakdown by hour](/images/gender_breakdown.png)
Here the same information is presented with the genders seperated. There is a seperate column for men and woman for each day of the week. It shows that the peak usage period do not very much between the genders.

![customer activity by hour](/images/customer_activity.png)
In this plot we have added another factor to the hourly breakdown. Here we can filter based on weither a ride was taken by a subscriber who has paid a monthly fee and a customer who just purchases one ride at a time.

![over all trip duration](/images/trip_duration.png)
This line graph shows the trip duration in minutes for all rides taken during the month. We can see that most customers use the bikes for just 5 minutes at a time

![duration by gender](/images/duration_gender.png)
Her the trip duration is broken down by gender. We can see that men make up the majority of the customer base. Men are almost three times as likely to get on one of the bikes. It is interesting to note that the distrobution of the length of rides for men and woman is very similar.
